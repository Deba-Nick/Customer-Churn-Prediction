# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on behavioral and demographic data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training using various classification algorithms. The goal is to help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.

Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations

Feature selection and engineering

Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more

Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Confusion matrix and performance visualization

🧠 Tech Stack:
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

📁 Dataset:
A telecom customer churn dataset (created using Numpy in collab)
